This repo contains the resources and scripts for the [AI doodle book tutorial](https://medium.com/@jingxin/create-a-doodle-book-with-ai-without-writing-a-single-line-of-code-bbdacde0e214), they will batch the steps in the entire pipeline, simplifying the tedious operations.

- `create_canny.py` put all your base images in the images folder, and run this script, it will create the canny edge images and saved in canny folder. (Batching step 3).
- `doodle_book.fig` contains serveral frames of the book, you can combine all your doodles into this file, and export them as a pdf. (As mentioned in the last step).

You can find my works right here, they can be downloaded for free, or join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/jtSE7EEeAK) to talk about new ideas and share your works.

Welcome to follow my Patreon account! I'll try my best to come up with a new set of doodle works with various themes every month (mainly depends on how fast my son can finish coloring them ðŸ˜‰).
